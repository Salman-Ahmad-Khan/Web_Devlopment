        The for Loop:
The ‘for’ loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes the following 
three important parts:
 The loop initialization where we initialize our counter to a starting 
value. The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.
 The test statement which will test if a given condition is true or not. If 
the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be executed,
otherwise the control will come out of the loop.
 The iteration statement where you can increase or decrease your 
counter.
You can put all the three parts in a single line separated by semicolons.

        The while Loop:
The most basic loop in JavaScript is the while loop which would be discussed in 
this chapter. The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code 
block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression 
becomes false, the loop terminates.

Syntax
The syntax of while loop in JavaScript is as follows:
while (expression)
{
 Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}
        */

            count++;
        }
        document.write("Loop stopped!");


        /*
        The do while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check 
happens at the end of the loop. This means that the loop will always be executed 
at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax
The syntax for do-while loop in JavaScript is as follows:
do{
 Statement(s) to be executed;
} while (expression);
Note: Don’t miss the semicolon used at the end of the do...while loop.

        */

        /*
        FOR-IN LOOP:
        The for...in loop is used to loop through an object's properties. As we have not 
discussed Objects yet, you may not feel comfortable with this loop. But once you 
understand how objects behave in JavaScript, you will find this loop very useful.
Syntax
The syntax of ‘for..in’ loop is:
for (variablename in object){
 statement or block to execute
}
In each iteration, one property from object is assigned to variablename and 
this loop continues till all the properties of the object are exhausted.*/
