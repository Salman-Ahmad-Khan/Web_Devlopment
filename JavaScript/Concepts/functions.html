    <h1>Functions in JavaScript</h1>
    <!-- 
        
    FUNCTIONS:
    A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your
program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It
helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to
divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
   
Function Definition
Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define
a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique
function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement
block surrounded by curly braces.

Syntax
The basic syntax is shown here.
<script type="text/javascript">

function functionname(parameter-list)
{
 statements
}

</script>

Function Parameters
Till now, we have seen functions without parameters. But there is a facility to
pass different parameters while calling a function. These passed parameters can
be captured inside the function and any manipulation can be done over those
parameters. A function can take multiple parameters separated by comma.

Example
Try the following example. We have modified our sayHello function here. Now it
takes two parameters.


The return Statement:
A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if
you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last
statement in a function.
For example, you can pass two numbers in a function and then you can expect
the function to return their multiplication in your calling program.
Example
Try the following example. It defines a function that takes two parameters and
concatenates them before returning the resultant in the calling program


Nested Functions:
Prior to JavaScript 1.2, function definition was allowed only in top level global
code, but JavaScript 1.2 allows function definitions to be nested within other
functions as well. Still there is a restriction that function definitions may not
appear within loops or conditionals. These restrictions on function definitions
apply only to function declarations with the function statement.

function literals (another feature
introduced in JavaScript 1.2) may appear within any JavaScript expression,
which means that they can appear within if and other statements.


Function () Constructor:
The function statement is not the only way to define a new function; you can
define your function dynamically using Function() constructor along with the
new operator.
Note: Constructor is a terminology from Object Oriented Programming. You may
not feel comfortable for the first time, which is OK.
Syntax
Following is the syntax to create a function using Function() constructor along
with the new operator.
<script type="text/javascript">

var variablename = new Function(Arg1, Arg2..., "Function Body");

</script>

The Function() constructor expects any number of string arguments. The last
argument is the body of the function â€“ it can contain arbitrary JavaScript
statements, separated from each other by semicolons.
Notice that the Function() constructor is not passed any argument that
specifies a name for the function it creates. The unnamed functions created
with the Function() constructor are called anonymous functions.

    <form>
        <input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say hello">
        <input type="button" onclick="sayHello('Zara',19)" value="Say hello">
        <input type="button" onclick="secondFunction()" value="Call Function">
        <input type="button" onclick="ansFunction()" value="Call Function">
