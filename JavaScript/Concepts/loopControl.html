    <title>LOOP CONTROL</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- JavaScript provides full control to handle loops and switch statements. There may be a situation when you need to come out of a loop without reaching at its bottom. There may also be a situation when you want to skip a part of your code 
block and start the next iteration of the look.

To handle all such situations, JavaScript provides break and continue
statements. These statements are used to immediately come out of any loop or 
to start the next iteration of any loop respectively.
The break Statement
The break statement,  is 
used to exit a loop early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.
 -->
    <script>
        var x = 1;
        document.write("<br>Entering the loop<br /> ");
        while (x < 20) {
            if (x == 5) {
                break; // breaks out of loop completely
            }
            x = x + 1;
            document.write(x + "<br />");
        }
        document.write("Exiting the loop!<br /> ");


        /*
        The continue Statement:
The continue statement tells the interpreter to immediately start the next 
iteration of the loop and skip the remaining code block. When 
a continue statement is encountered, the program flow moves to the loop 
check expression immediately and if the condition remains true, then it starts
the next iteration, otherwise the control comes out of the loop.

This example illustrates the use of a continue statement with a while loop. 
Notice how the continue statement is used to skip printing when the index held 
in variable x reaches 5.
*/

        document.write(" <br>Entering the loop<br /> ");
        while (x < 10) {
            x = x + 1;
            if (x == 5) {
                continue; // skips to the next iteration,current code block will not be executed
            }
            document.write(x + "<br />");
        }
        document.write("Exiting the loop!<br /> ");


        /*
        Using Labels to Control the Flow
Starting from JavaScript 1.2, a label can be used with break and continue to 
control the flow more precisely. A label is simply an identifier followed by a 
colon (:) that is applied to a statement or a block of code. We will see two 
different examples to understand how to use labels with break and continue.
Note: Line breaks are not allowed between the ‘continue’ or ‘break’ statement 
and its label name. Also, there should not be any other statement in between a 
label name and associated loop.
Try the following two examples for a better understanding of Labels.
Example 1
The following example shows how to implement Label with a break statement.
*/
        document.write("Entering the loop!<br /> ");
        outerloop: // This is the label name
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            document.write("Outerloop: " + i + "<br />");
            innerloop:
            for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                if (j > 3) break; // Quit the innermost loop
                if (i == 2) break innerloop; // Do the same thing
                if (i == 4) break outerloop; // Quit the outer loop
                document.write("Innerloop: " + j + " <br />");
            }
        }
        document.write("Exiting the loop!<br /> ");
