    <!--All the HTML elements can be categorized into two categories (a) Block Level 
Elements (b)Inline Elements.
Block Elements:
Block elements appear on the screen as if they have a line break before and after them. 
For example, the <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>, 
<pre>, <hr />, <blockquote>, and <address> elements are all block level elements. They 
all start on their own new line, and anything that follows them appears on its own new 
line.

Inline Elements:
Inline elements, on the other hand, can appear within sentences and do not have to appear 
on a new line of their own. The <b>, <i>, <u>, <em>, <strong>, <sup>, <sub>, <big>, 
<small>, <li>, <ins>, <del>, <code>, <cite>, <dfn>, <kbd>, and <var> elements are 
all inline elements.  -->

<!-- Grouping HTML Elements:

There are two important tags which we use very frequently to group various other HTML 
tags (i) <div> tag and (ii) <span> tag

The<div> tag:
This is the very important block level tag which plays a big role in grouping various other 
HTML tags and applying CSS on group of elements. Even now <div> tag can be used to 
create webpage layout where we define different parts (Left, Right, Top etc.) of the page 
using <div> tag. This tag does not provide any visual change on the block but this has 
more meaning when it is used with CSS.
 -->

 <!-- First group of tags -->
<div style="color:red">
    <h4>This is first group</h4>
    <p>Following is a list of vegetables</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Beetroot</li>
    <li>Ginger</li>
    <li>Potato</li>
    <li>Radish</li>
    </ul>
   </div>


   <!-- First group of tags -->
<div style="color:rgb(0, 255, 85)">
    <h4>This is first group</h4>
    <p>Following is a list of vegetables</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Beetroot</li>
    <li>Ginger</li>
    <li>Potato</li>
    <li>Radish</li>
    </ul>
   </div>



   <!-- The <span> tag:
The HTML <span> is an inline element and it can be used to group inline-elements in an 
HTML document. This tag also does not provide any visual change on the block but has 
more meaning when it is used with CSS.


The difference between the <span> tag and the <div> tag is that the <span> tag is used 
with inline elements whereas the <div> tag is used with block-level elements.
