<!-- Grouping Content
The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group together several elements to create 
sections or subsections of a page.
For example, you might want to put all of the footnotes on a page within a <div> element 
to indicate that all of the elements within that <div> element relate to the footnotes. You 
might then attach a style to this <div> element so that they appear using a special set of 
style rules. -->
