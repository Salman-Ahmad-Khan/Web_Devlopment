    <!-- 
        CSS pseudo-elements are used to add special effects to some selectors. You do 
not need to use JavaScript or any other script to use those effects.

 A simple syntax of pseudo-element is as follows:
selector:pseudo-element {property: value}

CSS classes can also be used with the pseudo-elements:
selector.class:pseudo-element {property: value}

The most commonly used pseudo-elements are as follows:

1.
:first-line
 Use this element to add special styles to the first line of the text 
in a selector.

2.
:first-letter
 Use this element to add special style to the first letter of the text 
in a selector.

3.
:before
 Use this element to insert some content before an element.
4.
:after 
Use this element to insert some content after an element

    <!--1. The :first-line pseudo-element
     The following example demonstrates how to use the :first-line element to add 
     special effects to the first line of elements in a document.  -->
    <p class="noline"> This line would not have any underline because this belongs to noline class.</p>
    <p>The first line of this paragraph will be underlined
        as defined in the CSS rule above. Rest of the lines in this
        paragraph will remain normal. This example shows how to use

        be normal and will have font size 10 px;</h4>
    <h4>The first character of this paragraph will be 5em big
        and in red color as defined in the CSS rule above. Rest of the
        characters in this paragraph will remain normal. This example
        shows how to use :first-letter pseduo element to give effect to
        the first characters of any HTML element.</h4>




        <!-- 3.
