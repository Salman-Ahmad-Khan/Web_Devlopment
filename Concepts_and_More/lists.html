    <!-- HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must
contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain:
 <ul> - An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.
 <ol> - An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your
items.
 <dl> - A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are
arranged in a dictionary.

HTML Unordered Lists:
An unordered list is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence.
This list is created by using HTML <ul> tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet.
 -->

    <!-- You can use "type" attribute for <ul> tag to specify the type of bullet you like. By default,
it is a disc. Following are the possible options:
 -->

    <ul type="square">
        <li>Beetroot</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Radish</li>
    </ul>


    <!-- HTML Ordered Lists:
If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML
ordered list will be used. This list is created by using <ol> tag. The numbering starts at
one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with <li>. -->
    <!-- The type Attribute:
You can use type attribute for <ol> tag to specify the type of numbering you like. By
default, it is a number. Following are the possible options: -->
    <ol type="i" >
        <li>Beetroot</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Radish</li>
    </ol>
