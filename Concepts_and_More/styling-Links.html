    <!--  LINKS:
   This chapter teaches you how to set different properties of a hyper link using 
CSS. You can set the following properties of a hyperlink:
We will revisit the same properties when we will discuss Pseudo-Classes of CSS.
1. The :link signifies unvisited hyperlinks.
2. The :visited signifies visited hyperlinks.
3. The :hover signifies an element that currently has the user's mouse 
pointer hovering over it.
4. The :active signifies an element on which the user is currently clicking.



Usually, all these properties are kept in the header part of the HTML document.
Remember a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in 
order to be effective. Also, a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS 
definition as follows
-->


    <!--
            While defining pseudo-classes in a <style>...
    </style> block, the following points
    should be noted:
    1. a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in
    order to be effective.
    2. a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be
    effective.
    3. Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.
    4. Pseudo-classes are different from CSS classes, but they can be combined.-->
