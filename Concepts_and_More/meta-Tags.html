    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- To serve the static page with traditional Chinese characters, the webpage must contain a 
<meta> tag to set Big5 encoding:
 -->
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=Big5" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

    <!-- 
        HTML lets you specify metadata - additional important information about a document in a 
variety of ways.
 The META elements can be used to include name/value pairs describing 
properties of the HTML document, such as author, expiry date, a list of keywords, 
document author etc.
The <meta> tag is used to provide such additional information. This tag is an empty 
element and so does not have a closing tag but it carries information within its attributes.
You can include one or more meta tags in your document based on what information you 
want to keep in your document but in general, meta tags do not impact physical 
appearance of the document so from appearance point of view, it does not matter if you 
include them or not


Adding Meta Tags to Your Documents:
You can add metadata to your web pages by placing <meta> tags inside the header of 
the document which is represented by <head> and </head> tags. A meta tag can have 
following attributes in addition to core attributes:

1.Name:
 Name for the property. Can be anything. Examples include, keywords, 
description, author, revised, generator etc.

2.content:
 Specifies the property's value.

3.scheme:
 Specifies a scheme to interpret the property's value (as declared in the 
content attribute).
4.http-equiv:
Used for http response message headers. For example, http-equiv can be 
used to refresh the page or to set a cookie. Values include content-type, 
expires, refresh and set-cookie.

-------Specifying Keywords------
You can use <meta> tag to specify important keywords related to the document and later 
these keywords are used by the search engines while indexing your webpage for searching 
purpose.
